     STEP 1: Configure CJPAdController
     
     In this example, CJPAdController will use both iAd and AdMob - iAd will be preferred as it is first in the array
     Ads will be positioned at the bottom of the view - this is the default behaviour so is redundant in this example
     Ads will be requested after a 2 second delay after launch
     
     Obviously you will need to provide an actual ad unit ID for AdMob
     "Smart Size" banners will be used (this is YES by default so it's redundant in this example, but included for the sake of completeness
     adMobTestDeviceIDs should be replaced with the actual UDID's of any devices you are wanting to receive test ads on. The Simulator will automatically be added to this array.
